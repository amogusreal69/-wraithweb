      <h1>HalexyNodes Cloud</h1>
      <h2>Terms of Services</h2>
      <p>Hello Users,</p>
      
      <p>By using HalexyNodes's services, you expressly agree that your use of our platform is at your sole risk. Neither HalexyNodes Cloud nor its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, third-party content providers, licensors, sponsors, merchants, or partners warrant that our services will be uninterrupted or error-free. We do not guarantee the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of any information, content, service, or merchandise provided through HalexyNodes.</p>



     <p>Disclaimer: Under no circumstances shall HalexyNodes Cloud. or any other party involved in creating, producing, or distributing HalexyNodes be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages that result from the use of or inability to use our service, including but not limited to reliance on any information obtained from HalexyNodes or mistakes, omissions, interruptions, deletion of files or email, errors, defects, viruses, delays in operation or transmission, or any failure of performance, whether or not resulting from acts of God, communications failure, theft, destruction, or unauthorized access to HalexyNodes's records, programs, or services.</p>


    <p>Content Proprietary Rights: You acknowledge that HalexyNodes contains information, data, software, photographs, graphics, music, sounds, and other material (collectively "Content") that are protected by copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, or other proprietary rights. All Content is copyrighted as a collective work under the U.S. copyright laws, and HalexyNodes Cloud. owns a copyright in the selection, coordination, arrangement, and enhancement of such Content.</p>



    <p>Third Party Content: HalexyNodes Cloud has no editorial control over third-party content. Any opinions, advice, statements, services, offers, or other information that constitutes part of content expressed or made available by third parties are those of the respective authors or distributors and not of HalexyNodes Cloud or its affiliates.</p>



    <p>Termination of Agreement: This agreement is effective until terminated by either party. You may terminate this agreement at any time by logging into your account and clicking the "Delete Account" icon. HalexyNodes Cloud reserves the right to immediately terminate this Agreement with respect to any user that it considers unacceptable, or in the event of any breach by you of this Agreement. HalexyNodes Cloud may terminate or modify this agreement at any time and without notice.</p>


    <p>Acknowledgment: This Agreement represents the entire understanding between you and HalexyNodes Cloud regarding your relationship with Reyo and supersedes any prior statements or representations. By using the HalexyNodes's website, you signify your assent to be bound by this agreement.</p>


   <p>Refund Policy: Due to the nature of our services, all payments made to HalexyNodes Cloud are non-refundable, as permitted by law. This includes account credits purchased in advance, gateway fees, and other related charges. In the event of a payment dispute, claim, or chargeback, any active services with us will be terminated. Personal details about the client may be used as evidence in dispute cases.</p>


   <p>Cancellation of services is subject to a minimum contract period of one month. HalexyNodes Cloud operates on a prepaid model, and immediate cancellation requests before the end of the billing period do not entitle the client to a refund. Any unused period after cancellation will be forfeited.</p>


  <p>If a payment is made after the due date, a 10% late fee will be applied to the invoice, and the client's dedicated server(s) will be suspended automatically one day after the due date. Reactivation of suspended servers after payment, including the late fee, will only cover the remaining period until the next due date; no refund or extension will be provided for the suspended period.</p>


  <p>Failure to pay the invoice within seven days of the due date will result in termination of the client's dedicated server(s), with all data deleted. If payment is made after termination, new dedicated server(s) will be activated for the remaining period without changing the due date.</p>


  <p>In case of an overpayment, the excess amount will be held and automatically applied to future invoices. Clients facing difficulties in paying invoices on time are encouraged to contact our billing staff before the due date to discuss options for postponement based on account history and internal risk scores.
